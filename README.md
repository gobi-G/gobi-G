Senior frontend engineer (TypeScript, React & React Native) with a product mindset. I ship end-to-end, keep things healthy in production (including on-call), and iterate with data. AI enthusiast — I like integrating LLMs where they improve developer and user experience.

- 🧠 AI: LLM integrations and prompt design
